Cloud Native is a software approach that focuses on building, deploying, and managing modern applications in cloud computing environments. It allows companies to build highly scalable, flexible, and resilient applications that can be updated quickly to meet customer demands. This approach benefits businesses by increasing efficiency, reducing cost, and ensuring availability. Cloud-native applications consist of multiple small, interdependent services called microservices, which work independently and take minimal computing resources to run.

Cloud-native applications are more agile than traditional enterprise applications, as they use a collaborative approach and are highly scalable on different platforms. The [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io) is an open-source foundation that supports organizations in developing critical cloud-native components, including Kubernetes.

The cloud-native architecture combines software components that development teams use to build and run scalable cloud-native applications. The CNCF lists immutable infrastructure, microservices, declarative APIs, containers, and service meshes as the technological blocks of cloud-native architecture.

Immutable infrastructure ensures that servers for hosting cloud-native applications remain unchanged after deployment, while microservices are loosely coupled software components that communicate with each other. APIs bring loosely coupled microservices together, and service mesh manages communication between microservices. Containers are the smallest compute unit in a cloud-native application, allowing developers to deploy applications on premises, cloud infrastructure, or hybrid clouds.

Cloud-native application development is a method used by developers to build and deploy applications that are designed to meet changing user expectations. It involves adopting specific software practices to reduce the delivery timeline and deliver accurate features. Common practices include continuous integration (CI), continuous delivery (CD), DevOps, and serverless computing.

The benefits of cloud-native development include faster development, platform independence, cost-effective operations, and consistency in the operating environment. Developers can build ready-to-deploy containerized applications with DevOps practices, allowing them to respond quickly to changes without shutting down the app. The cloud-native stack consists of several layers, including the infrastructure layer, provisioning layer, runtime layer, orchestration and management layer, application definition and development layer, and observability and analysis tools.

Cloud computing refers to software infrastructure hosted on an external data center and made available to users on a pay-per-use basis. Companies can use on-demand cloud-native services from a cloud provider, while cloud-enabled applications are legacy enterprise applications modified to run on the cloud. Cloud-native applications, on the other hand, are designed to reside in the cloud from the start, utilizing cloud technologies like microservices, container orchestrators, and auto scaling.

In summary, cloud-native application development offers several benefits, including faster development, platform independence, cost-effective operations, and the ability to build and run applications with the cloud computing model.
